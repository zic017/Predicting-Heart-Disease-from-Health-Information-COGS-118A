# Heart Disease Prediction from Health Indicators

This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on 300,000 patientsâ€™ health data of BMI, sleep, and addiction using 4 machine learning models:
1. Logistic regression
2. Decision tree
3. Support vector machine
4. K-nearest-neighbor 

## Roadmap

- FinalProject_group011.ipynb: code for exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and machine learning models to predict heart disease
